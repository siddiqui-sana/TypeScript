1. Watch mode: To allow specifying a file, so if any change made in that file, the recomilation will happen automatically.
    Command: tsc FILE_NAME --Watch

2. When we have more than one files: 
    Only ones run "tsc --init". So this will initialize the project(in which you run this command) as typescript
     project. Now this folder/project will be managed by Ts.
     What it does is, it creates a tsconfig.json file. This folder lies in the root of the TS project
     Now by only running "tsc" and not giving any file name, all TS files in that project will get compiled.
    
3. In tsconfig file, we can add file name in "exclude" which we don't want to get comopiled when tsc is run. Ex: node_modules
    And if we use "include", then whatever files we write in it, will specifically be included in the compilation process.
    "files" : [] Will help in including only file that we want to compile.

4. sourceMaps: true 
    This will create map files of the Ts filesa fter compilation, so in the browser dev tools source tab, we can see the ts files as well. 
    So great help for debugging.

5. Structure of TS project:
    src:This folder holds All the files that we create
    dist: THis folder will hold the complied files. When we set it in the outdir in tsconfig.json file.
    "outDir": "./dist"
    Also then we will have to change the path in the script tag for these files.
    "rootDir": "./src" This will specify that our code is in the src folder, so COMPILER WON'T LOOK FOR CODE ANYWHERE
    ELSE.
